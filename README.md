# IdleAgent

## Project for "Practical modeling of virtual agents" WS2018/19.

The aim of this project was the development and evaluation of an appropriate neutral 3D agent model. Beside the modelling of the characters appearance, creating neutral idle behaviour was one of the main concerns. We tried to include current research in regards of idle behaviour and emotional-neutral appearance of the character. Furthermore, we prepared a small study in which different actions were compared in terms of neutrality, weirdness, attraction and possible attention triggers.
